# Wastewater-Treatment-Formulation
This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to assess the treatability of a functioning Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) or Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) in the paper sector. Key parameters like Decay Coefficients and Half Life Constant were predicted.
The project involved analysing operational data, including influent and effluent biological oxygen demand, flow rates, and tank dimensions. Two modelling approaches were employed: linear regression for fitting data to theoretical models and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for direct prediction of output variables based on input parameters.
